Hello this is Gaurish Gupta,
I developed an automated search bar using HTML, CSS, JavaScript only,<br>
<img src="https://github.com/guptagaurish/searchbar/blob/master/appear.jpg" width="500" height="300"/>

<b>Its functionality includes</b>
1. Fetch data both statically and dynamically
2. show suggestions from the json file
3. select the clicked element
4. make a google search on clicking search button.

It takes the Vanilla JavaScript and its features to develop it.
